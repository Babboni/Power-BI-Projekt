# Power-BI-Projekt
This Power BI project has been prepared and completed based on completed Data Academy course from Engeto.com in order to receive a certification.
I took this course, because I was lacking the knowledge of reporting, which is very beneficial at my current position as Master Data Analyst.
Power BI is used at the company I work at. The reporting was previously handled by my previous colleague, and I took over that responsibility.
The source of data in this report has been amended to keep anonymity of requestors, the vendors and customers.
Since I daily process customer and vendor requests via the online Workflow tool, I have prepared a report summarizing the amount and type of requests.
